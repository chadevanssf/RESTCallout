<h1>REST Callout</h1>

<p>
A framework to make it easier (read less coding) to make REST calls from Salesforce. Currently it supports the following
use cases:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Input data is taken from a Salesforce Object, REST call is made, result is stored in Salesforce Object</li>
<li>A list of results is retrieved as REST call and shown using an External Object.</li>
</ol>
